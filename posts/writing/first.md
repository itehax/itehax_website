# **Portable executable** explained throught **rust** code

**Foreword**: In this post I am going to discuss the **PE format** and write a parser to analyze the structure of this format.
This is the first post about reverse engineering/malware analysis on my site.
A tutorial on how to write a disassembler and debugger, again using rust, will be coming out soon.
All of this will be preparatory to the series devoted to __game hacking__ using rust that I plan to do.

[Here](https://github.com/itehax/pe_parser) you can find the repository of the project.

## Let's start

### Portable executable??
The Portable Executable (PE) format is a file format for executables, object code, DLLs and others used in 32/64 bit versions of **Windows** operating systems.

In short, it is a format that contains all the information required by the windows loader to run our file.
For unix operating systems, there is a similar format called [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format).

Here an overview of the format:

#### How can we parse PE using rust?

To parse the format we will use rust, and windows api, which contain the data structures we need to interpret the format correctly.
There are several crates in rust, including the official microsoft bindings, which we are going to use.
Microsoft, offers [2 different crates](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs): windows and windows-sys, in a nutshell, the main difference is that the former offers methods on the bindings of the api that allow us to make the code more idiomatic, for example the Default trait on the structs offered by the windows api, this is at the expense of compilation time, which is faster in the latter case.
In addition, it provides the most comprehensive API coverage for the Windows operating system, but you are not going to be able to use them in the no-std environment.
More information [here](https://kennykerr.ca/rust-getting-started/index.html). 
In our case, we will use the windows crate.

As explained [here](https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/posts/deserializing-binary-data-files/), a classic method of deserializing a struct from a binary file is to read the file, go to the offset we are interested in and cast the struct containing our fields at that location, so that they are filled with the data we are interested in,of course correctly this is done if certain constraints are met,such as that the file is correctly formed.For simplicity's sake and in that this is not intended to be a "professional" pe parser, we will use this method, which of course has its disadvantages and advantages.

This is the code that deals with doing this in C , another similar approach would use ```memcpy```.


<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">C</p>
                </div>

```C
struct my_struct { int a, b, c; char d[0xFF]; };
my_struct* s = (my_struct*) (pointer_to_file);
```
</div>

The correspondent in rust,we will use `std::slice::from_raw_parts_mut`, which is an unsafe function, we are using that because in the case that our file is badly formatted, we have no interest in continuing the program, alternatively there are other less performing options.

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">Rust</p>
                </div>

```rust
fn fill_struct_from_file<T>(structure: &mut T, file: &mut File) {
    unsafe {
        let buffer =
            std::slice::from_raw_parts_mut(structure as *mut T as *mut u8, mem::size_of::<T>());
        file.read_exact(buffer).expect("Unable to fill_struct_from_file");
    }
}
```
 </div>

I want to point it out that `std::slice::from_raw_parts_mut` takes as a parameter a `data: *mut T `, we are converting this pointer to a mutable pointer to u8 in order to call  `file.read_exact(buffer)`, which expect a `buf: &mut [u8]`.
In short, we are creating a slice of the type `&mut [u8]` from our type `T` and then saving the content of the file in this struct.

Actually such kind of reasoning is very common in game hacking/malware writing, for example after a dll injection, we can go and read the memory of the process and fill our structs on which we will then implement the logic of what we want to do.

To be more precise, we also want the rust structure, to be the same as that of c/c++ in memory, to do this in rust there is a [way]( https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#the-c-representation) to specify the alignment of our struct, which in our case will be `#[repr(C)]` , in the case of winapi in rust, it has already been specified.

Now, let's dive in the PE format!

## The PE format

Before you go: a bit of terminology.
* **Base address**, also known as image base.   
This is the preferred address of the first byte of the image when it is loaded into memory. This value is a multiple of 64K bytes. The default value for DLLs is 0X10000000. The default value for applications is 0X00400000, except in Windows CE where it is 0X00010000.
Please note: This is a recommended value, in 2023 (the date of writing this post) in modern applications, address space layout randomization ([aslr](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/dynamicbase-use-address-space-layout-randomization?view=msvc-170)) is enabled for software security, so this value for most cases will be a random value generated on the fly.

* **Virtual address** (VA)
Allows reference to a part of the file in memory from the default base address.
* **Relative virtual address** (RVA)
Allows reference to a part of the file in memory without starting from the base address. This makes it more versatile , in that , to get the actual address you just have to add the base address to it.

* **Offset** or Raw address
It refers to the location of a value in the file saved on disk, thus without virtual memory.

In this post, I will explain the various structures from which the PE format is composed by placing side-by-side function calls that will dump them. 

Note: I am __not going to explain all field of the structures__, but only those that __will interest us__ for the parser, I will attach a link to the __documentation__ for the other cases.

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">Rust</p>
                </div>

```rust
let mut pe = PE::new(file_path);
if !pe.is_valid() {
    panic!("Invalid pe type")
}
pe.dump_dos_header();
    
pe.seek_magic();
pe.get_pe_type();

pe.seek_image_nt_header();
pe.dump_nt_header();

pe.dump_sections();

pe.dump_import();
pe.dump_export();
```
</div>


### Dos header and Dos stub
We start with `pe.dump_dos_header();` (we will talk about `pe.is_valid()` later).
When we open an .exe file (or any file that follows pe format) at offset 0, we will find the so-called magic number, 5A4D("MZ") which is an acronym for [Mark_Zbikowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zbikowski).

<img src="/images/blog_images/dos_header.png">

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">C</p>
                </div>

```C
typedef struct _IMAGE_DOS_HEADER {  // DOS .EXE header
        WORD   e_magic;                     // Magic number
        WORD   e_cblp;                      // Bytes on last page of file
        WORD   e_cp;                        // Pages in file
        WORD   e_crlc;                      // Relocations
        WORD   e_cparhdr;                   // Size of header in paragraphs
        WORD   e_minalloc;                  // Minimum extra paragraphs needed
        WORD   e_maxalloc;                  // Maximum extra paragraphs needed
        WORD   e_ss;                        // Initial (relative) SS value
        WORD   e_sp;                        // Initial SP value
        WORD   e_csum;                      // Checksum
        WORD   e_ip;                        // Initial IP value
        WORD   e_cs;                        // Initial (relative) CS value
        WORD   e_lfarlc;                    // File address of relocation table
        WORD   e_ovno;                      // Overlay number
        WORD   e_res[4];                    // Reserved words
        WORD   e_oemid;                     // OEM identifier (for e_oeminfo)
        WORD   e_oeminfo;                   // OEM information; e_oemid specific
        WORD   e_res2[10];                  // Reserved words
        LONG   e_lfanew;                    // File address of new exe header
} IMAGE_DOS_HEADER, *PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER;
```
</div>

This is the initial structure of the file which is here for backward compatibility reasons and is called **dos header**, so we are not going to dig into this structure. 
After this, we have the **dos stub** which is needed in case you wanted to run the file in a dos system, the string: 
> This program cannot be run in DOS mode.

would be printed, in a nutshell, in the dos stub we find the code that prints this string (obviously if it is not a 16-bit dos program). 

Now let's talk about **code**, I have defined this structure that will contain all the useful **fields** to parse the pe file, we will go into more detail on each of these as the post progresses.

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">Rust</p>
                </div>

```rust
struct PE {
    pe_type: PEType,
    file: File,
    image_dos_header: IMAGE_DOS_HEADER,
    image_nt_headers_32: IMAGE_NT_HEADERS32,
    image_nt_headers_64: IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64,
    sections: Vec<IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER>,
    import_section: IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER,
    export_section: IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER,
}
```
</div>


I promised you that we would talk about the function that checks whether the file we have **follows the PE format**. This is the function that takes care of that: 

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">Rust</p>
                </div>

```rust
fn is_valid(&mut self) -> bool {
    fill_struct_from_file(&mut self.image_dos_header, &mut self.file);

    if self.image_dos_header.e_magic != IMAGE_DOS_SIGNATURE {
        return false;
    }
    true
}
```
</div>

In a nutshell, we save the beginning of the file in a variable of type `IMAGE_DOS_HEADER`, so the fields of the struct will be filled with the corresponding values taken from the text file.
Next we just check that the first `e_magic` field matches the `IMAGE_DOS_SIGNATURE` ("MZ") constant.

After this check, we will go to print the dos header.


A very important field in this structure is the `e_lfanew` which will point to the location of the next header we are going to deal with: the **file header**.

### File header

Before parsing it, we need to determine whether our file is **32-bit** or **64-bit**.


<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">C</p>
                </div>

```C
typedef struct _IMAGE_NT_HEADERS {
        DWORD                   Signature; // The bytes are "PE\0\0".
        IMAGE_FILE_HEADER       FileHeader;
        IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32 OptionalHeader;
} IMAGE_NT_HEADERS32, *PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS32;
```
</div>

The pe file header, is defined in the struct [`_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-image_nt_headers32). 
There is this version and the 64-bit version, the difference will be in the [`OptionalHeader`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-image_optional_header32) field, which will be of type `IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER64`. 
The `OptionalHeader`, ironically is not that optional because the loader need it to run the executable
properly.


<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">C</p>
                </div>

```C
typedef struct _IMAGE_FILE_HEADER {
        WORD  Machine;
        WORD  NumberOfSections;
        DWORD TimeDateStamp;
        DWORD PointerToSymbolTable;
        DWORD NumberOfSymbols;
        WORD  SizeOfOptionalHeader;
        WORD  Characteristics;
} IMAGE_FILE_HEADER, *PIMAGE_FILE_HEADER;
```
</div>

This is the [image file header](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-image_file_header).

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">C</p>
                </div>

```C
typedef struct _IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER {
        WORD                 Magic;
        BYTE                 MajorLinkerVersion;
        BYTE                 MinorLinkerVersion;

        DWORD                BaseOfCode;
        DWORD                BaseOfData;
        DWORD                ImageBase;
        DWORD                SectionAlignment;
        DWORD                FileAlignment;
        WORD                 MajorOperatingSystemVersion;
        WORD                 MinorOperatingSystemVersion;
        WORD                 MajorImageVersion;
        WORD                 MinorImageVersion;
        WORD                 MajorSubsystemVersion;
        WORD                 MinorSubsystemVersion;
        DWORD                Win32VersionValue;
        DWORD                SizeOfImage;
        DWORD                SizeOfHeaders;
        DWORD                CheckSum;
        WORD                 Subsystem;
        WORD                 DllCharacteristics;
        DWORD                SizeOfStackReserve;
        DWORD                SizeOfStackCommit;
        DWORD                SizeOfHeapReserve;
        DWORD                SizeOfHeapCommit;
        DWORD                LoaderFlags;
        DWORD                NumberOfRvaAndSizes;
        IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY DataDirectory[IMAGE_NUMBEROF_DIRECTORY_ENTRIES];
} IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32, *PIMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32;
```
</div>

This is the image optional header 32.

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">C</p>
                </div>

```C
typedef struct _IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER64 {
        WORD                 Magic;
        BYTE                 MajorLinkerVersion;
        BYTE                 MinorLinkerVersion;

        DWORD                BaseOfCode;
        ULONGLONG            ImageBase;
        DWORD                SectionAlignment;
        DWORD                FileAlignment;

        WORD                 MajorSubsystemVersion;
        WORD                 MinorSubsystemVersion;
        DWORD                Win32VersionValue;
        DWORD                SizeOfImage;
        DWORD                SizeOfHeaders;
        DWORD                CheckSum;
        WORD                 Subsystem;
        WORD                 DllCharacteristics;
        ULONGLONG            SizeOfStackReserve;
        ULONGLONG            SizeOfStackCommit;
        ULONGLONG            SizeOfHeapReserve;
        ULONGLONG            SizeOfHeapCommit;
        DWORD                LoaderFlags;
        DWORD                NumberOfRvaAndSizes;
        IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY DataDirectory[IMAGE_NUMBEROF_DIRECTORY_ENTRIES];
} IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER64, *PIMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER64;
```
</div>

This is the image optional header 64.

The `magic` field indicates what we want to find, which is whether the file is 32 or 64 bit.

<img src="/images/blog_images/pe_type.png">

To access this field in the file we need to use some basic arithmetic, you should know that the  `e_lfanew`  field of the image dos header will point to the struct  `_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS`, from this location we want to access the first element of the image optional header, so let's add the size of u32 (that would be the size of the dword signature in the image nt headers) and the size of the `IMAGE_FILE_HEADER`, in this way we will be at the beginning of the image optional header, being the first field what we are interested in (magic), we will just read a dword at that position to get it.


<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">Rust</p>
                </div>

```rust
fn seek_magic(&mut self) {
    let _magic_pos = self
        .file
        .seek(SeekFrom::Start(
        self.image_dos_header.e_lfanew as u64
                + mem::size_of::<IMAGE_FILE_HEADER>() as u64
                + mem::size_of::<u32>() as u64, //size of pe signature
            ))
        .expect("Unable to seek magic pe value in the file");
}

```
</div>

After reading this field, we can compare it with the constants  `IMAGE_NT_OPTIONAL_HDR32_MAGIC` and ` IMAGE_NT_OPTIONAL_HDR64_MAGIC` to figure out whether the file is 32-bit or 64-bit.

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">Rust</p>
                </div>

```rust
fn get_pe_type(&mut self) {
    let mut pe_type = IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER_MAGIC::default();
    fill_struct_from_file(&mut pe_type, &mut self.file);

    match pe_type {
        IMAGE_NT_OPTIONAL_HDR32_MAGIC => {
            self.pe_type = PEType::PE32;
        }
        IMAGE_NT_OPTIONAL_HDR64_MAGIC => {
            self.pe_type = PEType::PE64;
        }
        _ => panic!("Invalid pe type"),
    }
}

```
</div>

As I explained, there are 2 structures for the `_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS`, the 32 and the 64 structure, depending on the type of pe file we are going to parse the file and save the data in the appropriate structure, the offset of the structure, as already explained is in the ` e_lfanew` field.

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">Rust</p>
                </div>

```rust
fn seek_image_nt_header(&mut self) {
    let _image_nt_header_pos = self
        .file
        .seek(SeekFrom::Start(self.image_dos_header.e_lfanew as u64))
        .expect("Unable to seek image_nt_header structure in the file");
 }
```
</div>

Now all we have to do is dump the fields we are interested in.
I would like to pay special attention to the `DataDirectory` field in the optional image header, which is an array of `IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY`.

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">C</p>
                </div>

```C
typedef struct _IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY {
  DWORD VirtualAddress;
  DWORD Size;
} IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY;
```
</div>

The `VirtualAddress` field is the RVA of the directory in question, while the `Size` is the size of the directory, in particular these fields will be useful for us to identify in which __sections__ our directories are located.
To access the various directories these are the indexes.

Now some may wonder, what is a data directory? 
In a nutshell it's a piece of __data__ located within a **section** (which we will discuss later), this data is useful for the windows loader to properly execute the file, such as __directory import__ and __directory export__.

Now that we have parsed the `OptionalHeader`(contained in the `_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS`), we can talk about sections. 

### Sections

A **section** contain the main content of the file, including __code__, __data__, __resources__, and __other__ executable
information.
An example of a section, is **.text**, in which we usually find the (compiled) code we wrote.

<img src="/images/blog_images/sections.png">

To parse the sections correctly, first we need to know how many there are. To know this, in the header file, we have a field called, `NumberOfSections` which is obviously what we need.

What we are going to parse is defined in the [`_IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-image_section_header).

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">C</p>
                </div>

```C
typedef struct _IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER {
  BYTE  Name[IMAGE_SIZEOF_SHORT_NAME];
  union {
    DWORD PhysicalAddress;
    DWORD VirtualSize;
  } Misc;
  DWORD VirtualAddress;
  DWORD SizeOfRawData;
  DWORD PointerToRawData;
  DWORD PointerToRelocations;
  DWORD PointerToLinenumbers;
  WORD  NumberOfRelocations;
  WORD  NumberOfLinenumbers;
  DWORD Characteristics;
} IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER, *PIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER;
```
</div>


<img src="/images/blog_images/section_table.png">

These sections, are in a **table**, which starts after the nt header position. So to access the nth table, we just multiply the size of the structure by the position we want to access.


<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">Rust</p>
                </div>

```rust
fn seek_nth_section(&mut self, nth: usize) {
    let image_nt_header_size = match self.pe_type {
        PEType::PE32 => mem::size_of::<IMAGE_NT_HEADERS32>(),
        PEType::PE64 => mem::size_of::<IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64>(),
    } as u64;

    let _nth_section_pos = self
        .file
        .seek(SeekFrom::Start(
            self.image_dos_header.e_lfanew as u64
                + image_nt_header_size
                + (nth * mem::size_of::<IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER>()) as u64,
        ))
        .expect("Unable to seek nth section in the file");
}


fn get_sections(&mut self) {
    for i in 0..number_of_sections as usize {
        self.seek_nth_section(i);

        let mut section = IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER::default();
        fill_struct_from_file(&mut section, &mut self.file);
        self.sections.push(section);
    }
}

```
</div>

Here is the code for dumping section's information.

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">Rust</p>
                </div>

```rust
fn dump_sections(&mut self) {
    self.get_sections();

    println!("Sections header:");
    for section in &self.sections {
        let section_name = std::str::from_utf8(&section.Name).expect("Unable to get section name");
        println!("    {}", section_name);
        println!("        virtual address -> {:#x}", section.VirtualAddress);
        unsafe {
            println!("        virtual size -> {:#x}", section.Misc.VirtualSize);
        }
        println!(
            "        pointer to raw data -> {:#x}",
            section.PointerToRawData
        );
        println!("        size of raw data -> {:#x}", section.SizeOfRawData);
        println!(
            "        characteristics -> {:#x}\n",
            section.Characteristics.0
        );
    }
}
```
</div>

Now comes the most __difficult__ and most __important__ part of the parser.
We are going to parse the __import directory__ and the __export directory__.

### Import and Export directory

The import directory __contains all the dlls__ (dynamic link libraries, you can see them as dynamic dependencies) and __the functions__ within them that the program needs to run properly.
The windows loader will fetch all the required dlls and map them to process memory so that our program can access them.
Note: the import directory is very important, especially in reverse engineering and malware analysis, as it gives us a general idea of what the program will do (more info in future posts).

<img src="/images/blog_images/import.png">

Before we delve into these two directories, I would like to remind you that as I have explained, these **are located within a section**, I will now explain how to find which section they are in, as to get the offset of these two in the binary will be necessary.

Now I can post the complete code to get the sections.


<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">Rust</p>
                </div>

```rust
fn get_sections(&mut self) {
    let (import_rva, export_rva, number_of_sections) = match self.pe_type {
        PEType::PE32 => (
            self.image_nt_headers_32.OptionalHeader.DataDirectory
                [IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT.0 as usize]
                .VirtualAddress,
            self.image_nt_headers_32.OptionalHeader.DataDirectory
                [IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT.0 as usize]
                .VirtualAddress,
            self.image_nt_headers_32.FileHeader.NumberOfSections,
        ),
        PEType::PE64 => (
            self.image_nt_headers_64.OptionalHeader.DataDirectory
                [IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT.0 as usize]
                .VirtualAddress,
            self.image_nt_headers_64.OptionalHeader.DataDirectory
                [IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT.0 as usize]
                .VirtualAddress,
            self.image_nt_headers_64.FileHeader.NumberOfSections,
        ),
    };

    for i in 0..number_of_sections as usize {
        self.seek_nth_section(i);

        let mut section = IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER::default();
        fill_struct_from_file(&mut section, &mut self.file);
        //we want to check in which section the import directory is
        if import_rva >= section.VirtualAddress
            && import_rva < section.VirtualAddress + unsafe { section.Misc.VirtualSize }
        {
            self.import_section = section;
        }
        //we want to check in which section the export directory is
        if export_rva >= section.VirtualAddress
            && export_rva < section.VirtualAddress + unsafe { section.Misc.VirtualSize }
        {
            self.export_section = section;
        }

        self.sections.push(section);
    }
}
```
</div>

What we most care about is this piece of code:
<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">Rust</p>
                </div>

```rust
fn get_sections(&mut self) {
    let (import_rva, export_rva, number_of_sections) = match self.pe_type {
        PEType::PE32 => (
            self.image_nt_headers_32.OptionalHeader.DataDirectory
                [IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT.0 as usize]
                .VirtualAddress,
            self.image_nt_headers_32.OptionalHeader.DataDirectory
                [IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT.0 as usize]
                .VirtualAddress,
            self.image_nt_headers_32.FileHeader.NumberOfSections,
        ),
        PEType::PE64 => (
            self.image_nt_headers_64.OptionalHeader.DataDirectory
                [IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT.0 as usize]
                .VirtualAddress,
            self.image_nt_headers_64.OptionalHeader.DataDirectory
                [IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT.0 as usize]
                .VirtualAddress,
            self.image_nt_headers_64.FileHeader.NumberOfSections,
        ),
    };

    //we want to check in which section the import directory is
    if import_rva >= section.VirtualAddress
        && import_rva < section.VirtualAddress + unsafe { section.Misc.VirtualSize }
    {
        self.import_section = section;
    }
    //we want to check in which section the export directory is
    if export_rva >= section.VirtualAddress
        && export_rva < section.VirtualAddress + unsafe { section.Misc.VirtualSize }
    {
    self.export_section = section;
    }
}
```
</div>

In a nutshell, what this code is doing is checking that the import/export rva is within the __section range__, so it can figure out which section it is in.
Basically is checking if `section_address <= import_rva < last_section_address`.

The code is fairly intuitive,
`section.VirtualAddress + unsafe { section.Misc.VirtualSize }` gives us the final address of the section , so we can check if the directory is within the latter.


Now comes the hard part... get ready.

### Import directory

We know the rva of the import directory and the rva of the section we are in.
To get the offset of the directory import, we need the field, `PointerToRawData`, which we find in the struct that contains the section of the directory import.
This field, tells us where this section is located in the file on disk(the offset, in a nutshell), now all we have to do is make the __difference between the rva of the import directory and the rva of the section we are in, note, the former will be greater than the latter, this way we get the distance from the import directory and the rva of the section.__
__Adding this distance to the offset of the a section, we get the actual position on disk of the import directory__.

This logic will be repeated several times, so try to **understand it thoroughly**.
This is also well explained [here](https://www.ired.team/miscellaneous-reversing-forensics/windows-kernel-internals/pe-file-header-parser-in-c++).

Now, the import information is contained in the `IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR` struct.

</div>

We will have a number of these structs equal to the number of dlls imported, and each one will be after the other.

The fields we are interested in in this struct, are the `Name`, the `OriginalFirstThunk` and the `FirstThunk`.

Regarding the `Name`, it will contain an address that corresponds to the location of the file that contains the name of the dll, if the name address is zero, it means that we have finished all the imports.
What we will do, then, is to keep iterating and advancing (we will advance by the size of the `IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR`) until the imports are finished.

Regarding the `FirstThunk` and the `OriginalFirstThunk` the former, will point to the so-called __IAT__ (import address table), and the latter to the __ILT__ (import lookup table), also known as the import name table.

                </div>

```C
typedef struct _IMAGE_THUNK_DATA64 {
    union {
        ULONGLONG ForwarderString;  // PBYTE 
        ULONGLONG Function;         // PDWORD
        ULONGLONG Ordinal;
        ULONGLONG AddressOfData;    // PIMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME
    } u1;
} IMAGE_THUNK_DATA64;
typedef IMAGE_THUNK_DATA64 * PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA64;

typedef struct _IMAGE_THUNK_DATA32 {
    union {
        DWORD ForwarderString;      // PBYTE 
        DWORD Function;             // PDWORD
        DWORD Ordinal;
        DWORD AddressOfData;        // PIMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME
    } u1;
} IMAGE_THUNK_DATA32;
typedef IMAGE_THUNK_DATA32 * PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA32;
```
</div>


The structure they point to is `_IMAGE_THUNK_DATA`, on disk, the address of `Function` field will be the same as `AddressOfData`, at runtime however the address of `Function`, which corresponds to the __IAT__ , will be overwritten by the loader with the function va.

Note: this information is very useful for [iat hooking](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/code-injection-process-injection/import-adress-table-iat-hooking) :)

Now... some code.

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">

```rust

    let import_rva = match self.pe_type {
        PEType::PE32 => {

                [IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT.0 as usize]

        }
        PEType::PE64 => {

        if import_descriptor.Name == 0 && import_descriptor.FirstThunk == 0 {
            break;
        }

        let import_name_raw = self.import_section.PointerToRawData
            + (import_descriptor.Name - self.import_section.VirtualAddress);

        let import_name = self.get_import_name(import_name_raw);
        println!("import -> {}", import_name);

        self.dump_thunk(import_descriptor);

        import_directory_nth += 1;
    }
}
```
</div>

It is missing to explain how to print the name and the various functions, precisely this part of the code.

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">Rust</p>
                </div>

```rust
let import_name_raw = self.import_section.PointerToRawData
    + (import_descriptor.Name - self.import_section.VirtualAddress);

let import_name = self.get_import_name(import_name_raw);
println!("import -> {}", import_name)
self.dump_ilt(import_descriptor);
```
</div>

To get the location of the file where the string is, we must perform the reasoning done earlier, so add to the offset of the section the address pointing to the name minus the virtual address of the section.

Now a question remains, especially in rust:
> How can I read a cstring in a file at a given location?

Once we have the address, we will go and create a `BufReader` and set the location to the address offset. This way we can use the `read_until` [method](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.BufRead.html#method.read_until), which will continue reading the file until it finds the null character, saving it in a `Vec<u8>`. 

Next we convert the Vec to a String.

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">Rust</p>
                </div>

```rust
fn get_import_name(&mut self, import_name_raw: u32) -> String {
    let mut buf_reader = self.seek_import_name(import_name_raw);
    read_cstring_from_file(buf_reader)
}
fn seek_import_name(&mut self, import_name_raw: u32) -> BufReader<&File> {
    let mut buf_reader = BufReader::new(&self.file);
    buf_reader
        .seek(SeekFrom::Start(import_name_raw as u64))
        .expect("Unable to seek import name");
    buf_reader
}
fn read_cstring_from_file(mut buf_reader: BufReader<&File>) -> String {
    let mut import_name = vec![];
    buf_reader
        .read_until(b'\0', &mut import_name)
        .expect("Unable to read file until null character");

    CStr::from_bytes_until_nul(&import_name)
        .expect("Unable to convert bytes to cstr")
        .to_string_lossy()
        .to_string()
}
```
</div>

Now we are going to dump the name of the __functions__ and related __ILT__ and __IAT__.

The struct `_IMAGE_THUNK_DATA` will contain this info, since there can be multiple functions in a dll, to know when they are finished we need to check that all the fiels in the struct are set to zero.
To advance from thunk to thunk, we obviously just need the position of the first one and then multiply the size of the struct with the index we want, just as if it were accessing an element of an array.

There are two ways to call a function either by **name**, or by **ordinal**.
The [ordinal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/exporting-functions-from-a-dll-by-ordinal-rather-than-by-name?view=msvc-170) represents the position of the function's address pointer in the __export directory__.
To check that the function is imported by ordinal, just check that the most significant bit of `AddressOfData` is set, if it, all we need to do is print the ordinal.
In case it is imported by name instead, we need to read the address in `AddressOfData`, which will point to this structure.

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">C</p>
                </div>

```C
typedef struct _IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME {
    WORD    Hint;
    CHAR   Name[1];
} IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME, *PIMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME;   
```
</div>

Then we need to add 2 to the memory pointer by this address to skip the `Hint` field and get the string.
After that we just have to read the cstring at that location and print the address in ILT and IAT.

Now we are going to dump the export directory.

### Export directory

Regarding the export directory, we will find it(in most cases) in the dlls, what we are interested in is that this directory contains the __name and the corresponding function__ that can be __called__ by a program that will have that dll as a __dependency__.

<img src="/images/blog_images/export.png">

The export directory is defined in this way.

<div class="bg-blue-950 overflow-hidden rounded-md">
                <div class="flex justify-between px-4 items-center text-xs text-white">
                    <p class="text-sm">C</p>
                </div>

```C
typedef struct _IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY {
  DWORD Characteristics;
  DWORD TimeDateStamp;
  WORD  MajorVersion;
  WORD  MinorVersion;
  DWORD Name; // RVA to the ASCII string with the name of the DLL
  DWORD Base; // starting value for the ordinal number of the exports.
  DWORD NumberOfFunctions; // number of entries for exported functions.
  DWORD NumberOfNames; // number of string names for the exported functions.
  /*
  * These three values correspond to three RVAs
  * for tables, each table save some data:
  * AddressOfFunctions: each table entry saves the RVA of an exported function.
  * AddressOfNames: each table entry saves the RVA to a name of function.
  * AddressOfNamOrdinals: each table entry saves 16-bit ordinals indexes of functions.
  *
  * We can use these three tables to get the address of a DLL function
  * by name, using the next operation:
  * i = Search_ExportNamePointerTable (ExportName);
  * ordinal = ExportOrdinalTable [i];
  * SymbolRVA = ExportAddressTable [ordinal - Base];
  */
  DWORD AddressOfFunctions;
  DWORD AddressOfNames;
  DWORD AddressOfNameOrdinals;
} IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY,*PIMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY;  
```
</div>

First we should note that the export directory may not be present; if it is not present, the rva of the export directory will be zero, otherwise, as we did for the import, we want to __get the offset to this directory__. 
Once we are in the right location, we can cast our structure, which will therefore contain all the data about the file we are parsing.

In the struct, there is a field called, `NumberOfNames`, which will obviously tell us the number of functions imported by name, so now all we have to do is print the function name and its address and __repeat__ the NumberOfNames procedure times.

The `AddressOfFunctions` and `AddressOfNames` will point to __tables__ where each name/function address will be __contiguos__.

<img src="/images/blog_images/export_table.png">
<img src="/images/blog_images/export_name.png">


So all we have to do is multiply (as explained earlier), the size of the type we are going to read by the position, and add it to the initial address of the table. (As if we wanted to access an element of an array of that type, via pointer arithmetic.)

To access the function address, all we have to do is read a u32 at the address we want, and for the string, as we did with the imports, read until we find the null character.
